1. AW channel
    AWVALID
    AWREADY
    AWADDR
    AWSIZE - number of bytes to be transfered per transaction. 2**AWSIZE -> 1,2,4,16,64,128 (3 bits)
    AWBURST- burst type: fixed, incr, wrapped
    AWLEN  - specifies the length of transfers in a single transaction. AWLEN+1 -> no of transfers. AXI3 - 1 to 16, AXI4 - 1 to 256
    AWID
  
2. W channel
    WVALID
    WREADY
    WDATA
    WLAST
    WSTRB
    WID

3. B channel (write response channel):
    BRESP
    BVALID
    BREADY
    BID
  a. B channel sends out a response only once for single or burst transactions. towards the end after the slave is done writing the WDATA

4. AR channel
    ARVALID
    ARREADY
    ARADDR
    ARSIZE - 
    ARBURST-
    ARLEN  -
    ARID
  
5. R channel:
    RVALID
    RDATA
    RLAST
    RREADY
    RRESP
    RID
  a. during burst transfer the slave sends a RRESP for every data on RDATA on the same clock with valid

6. Features:
  a. Independent read and write
  b. Multiple outstanding transactions are allowed
  c. No strict timing relation between address and write/read channel
  d. support for unaligned data transfers - starting address of a burst can be anywhere and not needed to aligned with natural address boundary
  e. out of order transaction completion
  f. burst transactions based on start address - master just sends out the starting address and type of burst. slave calculates the next address in a burst transaction
